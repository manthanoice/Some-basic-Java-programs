# Some-basic-Java-programs
Just a nerd or geek who's trying his luck in programming.

Mostly in this I will try to do programs from https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples here and some by myself.

Here is the list of how you should look at programs in order and I have added a txt file named [Javagit.txt](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Javagit.txt) as well.
