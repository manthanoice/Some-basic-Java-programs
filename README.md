# Some-basic-Java-programs
Just a nerd or geek who's trying his luck in programming.

Mostly in this I will try to do programs from https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples here and some by myself.

Here is the list of how you should look at programs in order and I have added a txt file named [Javagit.txt](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Javagit.txt) as well. 

- ## Introduction

1. [How to take input from user](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/ByUser.java)

1. [Sum of two numbers](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Sum.java)

1. [Multiplication of float numbers](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/FloatMultiply.java)

1. [Find ASCII value of entered character](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/ASCII.java)

1. [To Compute Quotient and Remainder](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Division.java)

1. [Swap two number](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Swap.java)

- ## Type Casting

### 1. Character To String
 
   - [To convert Character to String using Character.toString(varchar) mathod](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToStr1.java)
 
   - [To convert Character to String using String.valueOf(Char array "c") function.](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToStr2.java)
 
   - [To convert Character to String using toCharArray() and toString(varchar) mathod](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/StrToChar.java)

### 2. Character To Integer
  
   - [To convert Character to Integer using simple Type casting](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToInt1.java)
  
   - [To convert Character to Integer using getNumericValue()](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToInt2.java)
  
   - [To convert Character to Integer using Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(varchar))](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToInt3.java)

### 3. Integer To Character
  
   - [To convert Integer to Character using simple Type casting](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/IntToChar1.java)
  
   - [To convert Integer to Character using forDigit() method](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/IntToChar2.java)
  
   - [To convert Integer to Character using addition method](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/IntToChar3.java)
