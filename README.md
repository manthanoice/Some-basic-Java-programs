# Some-basic-Java-programs
Just a geel who's trying his luck in programming.

Mostly in this I will try to do programs from https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples here and some by myself.

Here is the list of how you should look at programs in order as well.

1 - [ByUser.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/ByUser.java)

2 - [Sum.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Sum.java)

3 - [FloatMultiply.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/FloatMultiply.java)

4 - [ASCII.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/ASCII.java)

5 - [Division.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Division.java)

6 - [Swap.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Swap.java)

7 - [EvenOrOdd.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/EvenOrOdd.java)
