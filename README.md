# Some-basic-Java-programs
Just a geel who's trying his luck in programming.

Mostly in this I will try to do programs from https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples here and some by myself

Here is the list of how you should look at programs in order. Although I have also added text file

1 - [ByUser.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/ByUser.java)
2 - Sum.java
3 - FloatMultiply.java
4 - ASCII.java
5 - Division.java
6 - Swap.java
7 - EvenOrOdd.java
8 - Alphabet.java
