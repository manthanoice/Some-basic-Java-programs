# Some-basic-Java-programs
Just a nerd or geek who's trying his luck in programming.

Mostly in this I will try to do programs from https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples here and some by myself.

Here is the list of how you should look at programs in order and I have added a txt file named [Javagit.txt](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Javagit.txt) as well. 

- ## Introduction

- ## Type Casting

### 1. Character To String

   - [CharToStr2.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToStr2.java)
 
   - [StrToChar.java](url)

### 2. Character To Integer
  
   - [CharToInt1.java](https://github.com/manthanoice/Some-basic-Java-programs/blob/main/Type%20Casting/CharToInt1.java)
